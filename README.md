# hello-world-Samanthi
A place where I store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.
This hopefully will direct people to edits I suggest for the Open Refine Ecology tutorial Section 2 i.e.:
“Working with OpenRefine” found at: http://www.datacarpentry.org/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson/01-working-with-openrefine/

Underneath “Objectives” insert instead:
•	Create a new OpenRefine project from a CSV file.
•	Understand what facets are and use them to sort and summarize data.
•	Understand what a clustering tool is and use it against cells to undertake mass edits typos.
•	Manipulate data using previous steps with undo/redo.
•	Employ drop-downs to split values from one column into multiple columns.
•	Employ drop-downs to remove white spaces from cells.
